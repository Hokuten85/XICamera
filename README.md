## About

XICamera is an addon that allows to change the camera distance.

## Compatibility

XICamera works together with [Ashita v3](https://www.ashitaxi.com) as well as [Windower 4](http://www.windower.net). There are releases for Ashita v4 and Windower 5, but I have done extremely minimal testing.

## Installation

#### Manual and Windower Install

- Head over to the [Releases page](https://github.com/Hokuten85/XICamera/releases) and pick the ZIP that matches your launcher
- Follow the README.md inside the archive  for setup and configuration instructions

## Limitations

Normal camera behavior will very slightly depending on character movement. While the addon is on, the camera's ability to automatically trail behind you diminishes. You will stay in frame, but the camera doesn't swing behind you in the direction that you are running.

## Disclaimer

I tested XICamera to the best of my capabilities but I can not guarantee that it works without bugs for 100% of the time.
Use at your own discretion, I take no responsibility for any client crashes or data loss.

## Special Thanks

I'd first like to thank the creator of XIPivot. A huge majority of this code base was borrowed directly from that project. I didn't know how to do a majority of this, but after looking through that code base it gave me confidence that I could do something similar.

I'd also like to thank the Darkstar Project and Xiloader team. The code injection is largely copy/paste from xiloader.

## Support/Contributions

Feedback through Github issues and or the ffxiah forums is appreciated.
