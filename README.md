- Follow the README.md inside the archive  for setup and configuration instructions

## Limitations

Normal camera behavior will very slightly depending on character movement. While the addon is on, the camera's ability to automatically trail behind you diminishes. You will stay in frame, but the camera doesn't swing behind you in the direction that you are running.

Camera distances greater than 45 do not work very well and I'm not sure why yet. I'm not preventing you from setting higher than 45 as you can still get some cool visuals if you can manage to get the camera to stabilize. Running seems to help.

## Disclaimer

I tested XICamera to the best of my capabilities but I can not guarantee that it works without bugs for 100% of the time.
Use at your own discretion, I take no responsibility for any client crashes or data loss.
