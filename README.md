## About

XICamera is an addon that allows to change the camera distance.

## Compatibility

XICamera works together with [Ashita v3](https://www.ashitaxi.com) as well as [Windower 4](http://www.windower.net). There are releases for Ashita v4 and Windower 5, but I have done extremely minimal testing.

## Installation

- Head over to the [Releases page](https://github.com/Hokuten85/XICamera/releases) and pick the ZIP that matches your launcher
- Follow the README.md inside the archive for setup and configuration instructions

- May need C++ redistributable.

## Disclaimer

I tested XICamera to the best of my capabilities but I can not guarantee that it works without bugs for 100% of the time.
Use at your own discretion, I take no responsibility for any client crashes or data loss.

## Special Thanks

I'd first like to thank the creator of XIPivot. A huge majority of the original code base was borrowed directly from that project. I didn't know how to do a majority of this, but after looking through that code base it gave me confidence that I could do something similar.

## Support/Contributions

Feedback through Github issues and or the ffxiah forums is appreciated.
